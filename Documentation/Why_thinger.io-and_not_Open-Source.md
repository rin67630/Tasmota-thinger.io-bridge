# Why proprietary thinger.io over Open-Source solutions?  
Open source solutions based on MQTT, Influx, Grafana exist and are popular.  
You however need a lot of configuration and match the broker, the database and the dashboard softwares. You need a dedicated computer running all the time.
Alternatively, you need a host provider if you want to use your dashboards over the Internet, struggle with opening ports and TLS cryptography, which, as explained, the ESP8266 devices cannot manage.
Same, if you chose Home Assistant, locally fine, but if you want to access it from outside, you have to struggle with ports and IP addresses… Nothing really accessible to noobs.  
# Thinger.io goes a much easier way.  
Everything is integrated and the 1 to1 cryptography to remain safe is done by the IoT devices at a breeze. It works in a browser, worldwide and you configure the dashboards directly in-situ.  
Thinger.io is also fast, values can be updated every second and even faster.  
You don’t need anything else: no computer, no MQTT broker, no database, nothing else than your devices and a browser.   
Important for casual tinkerers: no subscription, no cost, no payment data to be disclosed!  
You get up to two devices, 4 dashboards, 4 data buckets, 4 endpoints to send e.g. eMails …  
For free, forever !
# What is the difference with e.g. Tuya?
Many IoT devices are sold with Tuya or other proprietary Internet-dashboards too.  
Yes, but those dashboards are designed by the vendor, providing just enough to sell their devices.  
With thinger.io you fully control your dashboards and can do much, much more with your IoT data.  
# What is behind that company, will they sell your data?
Free? Where is the catch?  
Of course, the owners of thinger.io want you to love it so much that you will go into a more powerful pay-subscription, which is the way to go for businesses and the way they finance their living.  
I did too, for a non-profit association, with their entry-level scheme.
But they will not nag you, as a tinkerer, if you don’t. They did not do in the past 3 years.  
# What about the future?
They will not do it in future too... Of course, if they get bought by a financial shark, that may change or they may get bankrupt.  
True, as a lot of things in real life !   
But let's be positive and just enjoy the free lunch, you have nothing to lose!
